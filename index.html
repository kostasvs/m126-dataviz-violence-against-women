						Being issue of critical importance nowadays as much as ever, violence against women
						concerns all forms of physical and sexual violence, as well as psychological abuse and
						controlling behaviours. Femicide is among the most horrendous forms of this major problem.

								While violent crimes are of equally high significance regardless of the victim gender,
								violence against women is a problem that needs to be addressed as a special case due to
								the
								specific factors that lead to its occurrence. The need for strategic prevention and
								response
								is apparent from the impact on the physical, sexual and mental health of the victims,
								which
								may at many cases be fatal.

								It has been 46 years since Diana Russell coined the word "Femicide" in March 1976 at the
								1st
								international tribunal for crimes against women in Brussels. The aim of this word was to
								make
								the world aware that the violent death of women is a crime that should not be confused
								with the
								gender-neutral term "Homicide". Characteristically, she had stated that 'it is
								impossible to
								mobilize against something without a name, that is, something that until now has been
								"invisible". Words are what gives meaning to the world.

						The victims are more often men than women.

					<p>
						Despite the fact that men are murdered more often than women, there are very few cases where
						this happens because of their gender. Femicide occurs in patriarchal societies, in which women
						are expected to be receptive and passive. So femicide, to give the definition, is the killing of
						a woman or girl mainly by a man (usually a partner) because of her gender alone. Elements such
						as patriarchal values can increase the risk of violence due to the belief that women can and
						should be controlled by men. They are exposed to all forms of violence and pressure. The right
						to life is violated. Its main characteristic is that it is systematic, continuous and conscious.
						Women face violence and are exposed to femicide around the world from childhood.

								Homicides in general context are quite rare. But they are the subject of media interest
								and
								numerous works of fiction. Usually these seem to focus on cases with unusual forms of
								homicide
								such as those with a sexual or unknown motive, as well as those carried out e.g. by a
								serial
								killer. On the contrary, data shows that the majority of murders are committed by the

								definitions of homicide may differ, resulting in challenges in the identification and
								recording
								of homicides. A typical example is Japan, which does not record homicides in a robbery

								homicides.

					<h1>How are homicides scattered across the world?</h1>
					<p class="lead py-2">
						Between 1990 and 2020, Brazil and India noted the highest counts of homicides.
						While the majority of the victims in Brazil were men, most victims in India were women.
					</p>
					<p class="lead pb-2">
						Shifting our focus to homicide counts relative to total population,
						El Salvador and Colombia have the highest counts. Considering male victims, Colombia is at the
						top,
						but female victims per total population are highest in Russia.
					</p>
					<p class="lead pb-2">
						The last few years seem to follow these same trends.
					</p>
					<p>
						Drug trafficking and gang activity is to blame for Brazil's high count of male victims.
						In contrast, the high femicide count in India is the result of multiple manifestations,
						including
						<a href="https://pha.berkeley.edu/2021/04/10/un-natural-selection-female-feticide-in-india/">female
							infanticide</a>,
						forced abortions,
						<a
							href="https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/india-news-love-in-the-crosshairs-honour-killings-still-continue-in-india/305349">honor
							killings</a>
						and
						<a
							href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/india/19-women-were-killed-for-dowry-every-day-in-2020-ncrb-10758421.htm">dowry
							murders</a>.
						These are a few of the various forms of femicide covering a very large percentage of murders
						committed by an intimate person, mainly a partner. Other notable cases include killing of women
						and girls during war, and killing of women due to sexual preference, decision to divorce,
						adultery or refusal to marry.
					</p>
					<p>
						The high homicide rate with male victims in Colombia and El Salvador is again due to the
						extent of drug trafficking, gang activity and gang violence. On the other hand, Russia's high
						count of femicides is a complex issue and linked to high rates of domestic violence, which was
						<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/23/russia-bill-decriminalize-domestic-violence">

					<h1>USA: What are the mechanisms used and the damage done?</h1>
					<p class="lead py-2">
						Firearms were the most common weapon used in homicides in the USA in 2020.
						This also applies for assault and sex offenses.
					</p>
					<p class="lead pb-2">
						Some form of weapon or offensive mechanism was used for 70% of sex offenses, and 90% of
						assaults.
					</p>
					<p class="lead pb-2">
						Non-homicide offenses usually resulted in minor injuries.
					</p>
					<p>
						Regarding the means used to carry out the murder, those with the highest percentages are weapons
						(handguns, shotguns, firearms, rifles), knives and sharp objects in general. The use of the last
						two should not surprise us, as they are readily available to everyone. Besides these, shootings
						are quite common among young men (the majority of offenders). Murders/homicides in which alcohol
						was involved are more likely (compared to non-alcohol-related homicides) not to involve a gun.
						In contrast, drug-related homicides have an increased chance of a gun being used by someone
						known to the victim.
					</p>
					<p>
						It goes without saying that where firearms and other deadly
						weapons are available, small disputes, differences and skirmishes have a greater chance of
						ending in a fatal outcome. Also, while the murder weapon is not our main concern, it is
						important to
						point out the correlation between the right to bear arms and the high murder rates in the US.

						To conclude, we reach 2 important “verdicts”.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							By informing the world about femicides the purpose is both to raise public awareness and
							potential victims to seek help and support. This work requires the collective participation
							of professionals such as teachers, health workers, members of the police force, judicial
							authorities, officials who know how to handle cases of gender-based violence, as well as
							women themselves in associations and communities.
						</li>
						<li>
							Femicide/feminicide whenever and wherever it occurs, it is vital that it be called by its
							name in the media and not by terms that have been heard much in the past such as "crime of
							passion" so that the seriousness of the crime is being felt by the public.
